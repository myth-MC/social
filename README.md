# 📚 Information

**social 🦜** is a fully modular plug-in focused on **enhancing your server's communication** without affecting the gameplay experience. 
It is developed using modern APIs, providing a **simple but powerful tool** for server owners and developers. 
**Everything can be configured**, including messages.

## 🤔 Features

* ✨ Fully compatible with [MiniMessage](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/index.html) and [PlaceholderAPI](https://wiki.placeholderapi.com) to have great-looking messages
* 🗣️ **Channel-based chat provider**. You can add or remove channels according to your server's needs. For example, you could have a global and a staff channel
* 😲 **Reactions** that appear above a player's head with nice animations
* 🧵 **Chat replies and threads**. Players can click on a message to reply to it.
* 🛡️ **Group chat channels**. Players can create their own group channel with `/group`. Server owners can see group messages with Social Spy.
* 😎 **Emoji support** in a very similar way as Discord: `:emoji_name:`
* ‼️ **Mentions** that work with usernames and nicknames.
* 🔗 **Server links**. Available since Minecraft 1.21, server links are a great way of sharing external resources with your players in the pause menu
* 📢 **Built-in announcements** with a configurable interval. Can broadcast messages through the action bar
* 🤫 **Private messages** with social spy for staff members
* 🖌️ **Advanced text formatting** with **bold**, _italics_, <ins>underline</ins> and more options
* 🤬 **Chat filters** that block IPs, URLs or words. Even in private messages
* 🌊 **Flood/spam prevention**
* ☕️ **Developer-friendly API** with countless possibilities. Developers can add custom channels, reactions, emojis, filters, keywords, formatters...
* 👀 **No dependencies**

| Formatter    | Gives a special format to a literal             | _configurable_ | ✅                      | `**hi**      ➡️ `**hi** |
| Emoji        | Replaces a literal with a unicode input (emoji) | :emoji:        | ✅                      | `:smile:     ➡️ 😄`     |
| Keyword      | Replaces a literal with a specific component    | [keyword]      | ✅                      | `[balance]   ➡️ 10.4$`  |
